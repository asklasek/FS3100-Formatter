# FS3100-Formatter

Creates a file that can be imported into the OI's (FS 3100) control software so the user no longer has to type in the samples 
by hand into the control software. Previously the user would have to hand enter all sample identification numbers and correctly input 
the required sequence of standard checks for the analysis to be valid. This software ensures I.D. numbers are not incorrectly input and 
that the standard checks occur at their proper time.

The software takes an input file that is generated from the sample database and outputs a file that the OI software can import.
